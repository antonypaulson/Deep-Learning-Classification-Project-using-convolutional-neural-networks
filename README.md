# Deep-Learning-Classification-Project-using-convolutional-neural-networks
This project was performed for classiication of 17 flower categories in the oxford dataset. The link to the dataset can be found below:

Convolutional Neural Networks were employed for this classification along with tranfer learning from the VGG dataset. The python notebook
contains a step by step approch to train the model and achieve the top1 and top5 accuracies
